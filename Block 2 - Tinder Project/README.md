# Project Speed Dating

## Project Target
Tinder has experienced a decrease in the number of matches and is trying to understand what makes people interested in each other. They have provided us with a dataset to understand the drivers for a second date.

## Key Findings
* The dataset is not correctly designed to answer the questions and cannot be used to take actions on Tinder's business model
   * Tinder is a matching application created in 2012 based on pictures and text descriptions
   * The survey is from 2002 and 2004 and is based on real dates from a pre-smartphone era
   * The dataset will not give any actionable findings for Tinder and will require further analysis of the Tinder database

* When looking at the dataset, it seems that participants are strongly biased and their scoring cannot be used to truly understand the rationale for matching
   * Intelligence is regularly mentioned as an important attribute but the rating of this characteristic is equal for both positive and negative answers
   * On the other hand, Fun and Shared Interests are not seen as important while they seem to be deal breakers for the final decision
   * Sharing the same race seems important for a large panel but it does not seem to impact the final decision

* Attractiveness, the only criterion that unanimously comes out of each analysis, cannot be used to truly understand the rationale for matching
   * Attractiveness is always declared as the most important criterion when participants are rating the criteria
   * The scorecard confirms that participants match with people they rate highly on Attractiveness
   * However, the criterion Attractiveness cannot be quantified and we cannot conclude on why people find other participants attractive

* Overall, this dataset is not conclusive because:
   * It is not in line with Tinder's business model
   * The information is too qualitative and not quantitative enough
   * It is mostly based on surveys and therefore very biased

## Recommendation
* Tinder should leverage its internal database to better understand the rationale for matching
   * Tinder is an online app and only online matches should be used to understand the behavior specific to its customers
   * With >65 billion matches overall, there is already an important dataset, which does not require qualitative surveys

* Tinder needs to better segment its database and use powerful machine learning tools
   * Information on each participant needs to be more detailed and quantitative to better define the profile of each participant
   * With better segmentation, Tinder should use Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning tools to get better correlations between each of the segments

* Based on this better understanding, Tinder will be able to offer subscriptions that will increase the probability of matching premium users
