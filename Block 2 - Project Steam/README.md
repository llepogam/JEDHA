# Key Insights


## Ubisoft review

Given Ubisoft's partnership with Epic, the Steam sales dataset seems not relevant to analyze gaming market and Ubisoft's position
- Ubisoft had not game released on Steam since its partnership with Epic in 2020
- The market share of Ubisoft cannot be analyzed as there are almost 3 years worth of release missing in the dataset
- Given Ubisoft decision, we can assume there are other case like this one and therefore, the dataset is not representative of the market

Based on the data before 2020, we can see that Ubisoft is the #1 published in revenues with $3.6bn in total, with a strong focus on paid games related to big franchise
- Ubisoft's games have made above $3.6bn between 2006 and 2020 with a peak in 2015, with the release of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege"
- On the free to play games, Ubisoft has only one significant game with arond 10k users, in 18th position of the F2P games
- 61% of sales are concentrated into 3 franchines: Tom Clancy's, Assassin's Credd and Far Cry
- However, there are no information of Ubisoft release since 2020


## Steam sales macro overview

There are around 55k games available on Steam with strong growth between 2012 and 2020 but limited eversince, especially following covid
- The CAGR of the number of games was 77.2% p.a. between 2012 and 2017 and +4.4% p.a. between 2017 and 2022
- The growth were stopped in 2022 where there were a huge dropped in number of games released this year
- We can assume that this was following the decrease in development in the covid period in 2020-2021 that delayed games supposed to be launched in 2022

Steam has strongly contributed to market access of small developpers
- The #1 genre is Indie game
- Large majority of developer and published have created between 1 and 3 games
- The growth in number of games has been driven by games with below 20k owners

However, this seems to still be a very competitive market and there is a high risk of over-supply and bankrupty among small developpers
- Most of the games have less than 20k owners
- All this small games have a very low number of rating, which would limits the reach to new customers
- In 2022, Indie Genre games have known one of the highest decrease in number of games released

## Business Model

Overall, the market seems to be split into two main distribution modes with their owen business models
- Free-to-play games are relying on the the number of concurrent users to get revenues on in-game sales
- Paid games are driving by games price tags, discount and number of owners
- Free-to-play is strongly competitive with a large number of games which does not seems profitable

The F2P market is highly concentrated as 2 games are gathering half of the users and 10 are covering 84% ot the total users
- More than 7.4k free to play games have below 100 concurrent users, where it would be difficult to be profitable
- Only 100 games out of the 7.7k F2P games available have more than 1,000 concurrent users
- Free to play game have strongly decreased between 2020 and 2022

On the paid games, there are sub_segment depending on the price tag which are also very competitive
- Price can vary from a few $ to more than $70 and reflect the production value : the more it costs, the better value for money the player is expecting
- Based on hypothesis to be confirmed, there is a direct correlation between price tag and development costs : the higher the production value the higher the cost
- For each segment, there are only 15% to 30% of the games which seems to be profitable, showing how competitive is the market


## Trends

Overal trend is showing that small developpers are shifting from free-to-play towards early access to insure cash collection
- There is a current over-supply in the gaming market that lead to reduction of game release in 2022
- This has mostly had an impact on free to play games and games with low price tag and production value
- Early access allow developper to be closer to the community, to finance better the game development and to correct bugs with direct feedbacks
