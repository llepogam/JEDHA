# Key Insights


## Ubisoft Review

Given Ubisoft's partnership with Epic, the Steam sales dataset is not relevant for analyzing the gaming market and Ubisoft's position:
- Ubisoft has not released games on Steam since its partnership with Epic in 2020
- Ubisoft's market share cannot be analyzed as there are almost 3 years worth of releases missing in the dataset
- Given Ubisoft's decision, we can assume there are other similar cases, and therefore, the dataset is not representative of the entire market

Based on the data before 2020, we can see that Ubisoft is the #1 publisher in revenues with $3.6bn in total, with a strong focus on paid games related to big franchises:
- Ubisoft's games have made over $3.6bn between 2006 and 2020, with a peak in 2015 with the release of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege"
- In the free-to-play category, Ubisoft has only one significant game with around 10k users, ranking 18th among F2P games
- 61% of sales are concentrated in 3 franchises: Tom Clancy's, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry
- However, there is no information on Ubisoft releases since 2020


## Steam Sales Macro Overview

There are around 55k games available on Steam with strong growth between 2012 and 2020 but limited growth since then, especially following COVID:
- The CAGR of the number of games was 77.2% p.a. between 2012 and 2017 and +4.4% p.a. between 2017 and 2022
- The growth stopped in 2022 when there was a huge drop in the number of games released that year
- We can assume this was due to decreased development during the COVID period in 2020-2021 that delayed games scheduled to launch in 2022

Steam has strongly contributed to market access for small developers:
- The #1 genre is Indie games
- A large majority of developers and publishers have created between 1 and 3 games
- The growth in the number of games has been driven by titles with fewer than 20k owners

However, this appears to be a very competitive market with a high risk of over-supply and bankruptcy among small developers:
- Most games have fewer than 20k owners
- All these small games have a very low number of ratings, which limits their reach to new customers
- In 2022, Indie genre games experienced one of the highest decreases in the number of games released

## Business Models

Overall, the market seems to be split into two main distribution modes with their own business models:
- Free-to-play games rely on the number of concurrent users to generate revenue from in-game sales
- Paid games are driven by game price tags, discounts, and number of owners
- The free-to-play market is highly competitive with a large number of games that do not seem profitable

The F2P market is highly concentrated, with 2 games gathering half of the users and 10 games covering 84% of the total users:
- More than 7.4k free-to-play games have fewer than 100 concurrent users, making it difficult to be profitable
- Only 100 games out of the 7.7k F2P games available have more than 1,000 concurrent users
- Free-to-play game releases strongly decreased between 2020 and 2022

For paid games, there are sub-segments depending on the price tag, which are also very competitive:
- Prices can vary from a few dollars to more than $70 and reflect the production value: the more it costs, the better value for money the player expects
- Based on a hypothesis to be confirmed, there is a direct correlation between price tag and development costs: the higher the production value, the higher the cost
- For each segment, only 15% to 30% of the games appear to be profitable, showing how competitive the market is


## Trends

The overall trend shows that small developers are shifting from free-to-play towards early access to ensure cash collection:
- There is a current over-supply in the gaming market that has led to a reduction in game releases in 2022
- This has mostly impacted free-to-play games and games with low price tags and production values
- Early access allows developers to be closer to the community, better finance game development, and correct bugs with direct feedback
