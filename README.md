<!-- PROJECT 1 -->
## Block 1 - Project Kayak

**Project Link:** [Project Kayak](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%201%20%20-%20Kayak%20Project)

### Project 🚧

The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

- Weather.
- Hotels in the area.

The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

 ### Goals 🎯

As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to:

- Scrape data from destinations.
- Get weather data from each destination.
- Get hotels' info about each destination.
- Store all the information above in a data lake.
- Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse.

<!-- PROJECT 2 -->
## Block 2 - Project Tinder

**Project Link:** [Project Tinder](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%202%20-%20Tinder%20Project)


### Project 🚧

The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

 ### Goals 🎯
Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:

You may use descriptive statistics
You may use visualisations

<!-- PROJECT 3 -->
## Block 2 - Project Steam

**Project Link:** [Project Steam](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%202%20-%20Project%20Steam)

### Project 🚧
You're working for Ubisoft, a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.

 ### Goals 🎯
The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

To carry out this project, you will have to adopt different levels of analysis. Your boss gave you a list of examples of questions that would be interesting:

Analysis at the "macro" level
- Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?
- What are the best rated games?
- Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?
- How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?
- What are the most represented languages?
- Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

Genres analysis
- What are the most represented genres?
- Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?
- Do some publishers have favorite genres?
- What are the most lucrative genres?

Platform analysis
- Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?
- Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?
- You're free to follow these guidelines, or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information. 🤓

<!-- PROJECT 4 -->
## Block 3 - Project Walmart

**Project Link:** [Project Walmart](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%203%20-%20Project%20Wallmart)

### Company's Description 📇
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

### Project 🚧
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

 ### Goals 🎯
The project can be divided into three steps:

- Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
- Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
- Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

<!-- PROJECT 5 -->
## Block 3 - Conversion Rate

**Project Link:** [Project Conversion Rate](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%203%20-%20Conversion%20Rate)

### Project 🚧
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

 ### Goals 🎯
The project can be cut into four steps :

- Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file data_train.csv
- Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
- Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file data_test.csv. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA 🤓). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
- Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?

<!-- PROJECT 6 -->
## Block 3 - Uber Pickups

**Project Link:** [Project Uber Pickups](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%203%20-%20Uber%20Pickups)

### Company's Description 📇

Uber is one of the most famous startup in the world. It started as a ride-sharing application for people who couldn't afford a taxi. Now, Uber expanded its activities to Food Delivery with Uber Eats, package delivery, freight transportation and even urban transportation with Jump Bike and Lime that the company funded.

The company's goal is to revolutionize transportation accross the globe. It operates now on about 70 countries and 900 cities and generates over $14 billion revenue! 😮

### Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.

(If you are not familiar with the bay area, check out Google Maps)

Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.

Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.

### Goals 🎯
Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:

- Create an algorithm to find hot zones
- Visualize results on a nice dashboard

<!-- PROJECT 7 -->
## Block 3 - North Face

**Project Link:** [Project North Face](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%203%20-%20North%20Face)

### Company's Description 📇
The North Face is an American outdoor recreation product company, founded in 1968 to supply climbers. The North Face produces clothing, footwear, and outdoor equipment. By the late 1990s customers had expanded beyond outdoor enthusiasts and in the 2000s it became a fashion style symbol.

### Project 🚧
The marketing department would like to take advantage of machine learning solutions to boost online sales on the website : https://www.thenorthface.fr/

They have identified two major solutions that could have a huge effect on the conversion rates :

Deploying a recommender system that will allow to suggest additionnal products to users, that are similar to the items they are already interested in. The recommendations could be materialized by a "you might also be interested by these products..." section that would appear on each product page of the website.
Improving the structure of the products catalog thanks to topic extraction. The idea is to use unsupervised methods to challenge the existing categories : is it possible to find new categories of product that would be more suitable for the navigation on the website ?

### Goals 🎯
The project can be cut into three steps :
- Identify groups of products that have similar descriptions.
- Use the groups of similar products to build a simple recommender system algorithm.
- Use topic modeling algorithms to automatically assess the latent topics present in the item descriptions.

<!-- PROJECT 8 -->
## Block 4 - Project AT&T

**Project Link:** [Project AT&T](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%204%20-%20Project%20AT%26T)

### Company's Description 📇
AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered at Whitacre Tower in Downtown Dallas, Texas. It is the world's largest telecommunications company by revenue and the third largest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S. As of 2022, AT&T was ranked 13th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $168.8 billion! 😮

### Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

### Goals 🎯
Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

<!-- PROJECT 9 -->
## Block 5 - Project GetAround

**Project Link:** [Project GetAround](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%205%20-%20Project%20GetAround)

GetAround is the Airbnb for cars. You can rent cars from any person for a few hours to a few days! Founded in 2009, this company has known rapid growth. In 2019, they count over 5 million users and about 20K available cars worldwide.

As Jedha's partner, they offered this great challenges:

### Context
When renting a car, our users have to complete a checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental in order to:

Assess the state of the car and notify other parties of pre-existing damages or damages that occurred during the rental.
Compare fuel levels.
Measure how many kilometers were driven.
The checkin and checkout of our rentals can be done with three distinct flows:

📱 Mobile rental agreement on native apps: driver and owner meet and both sign the rental agreement on the owner’s smartphone
Connect: the driver doesn’t meet the owner and opens the car with his smartphone
📝 Paper contract (negligible)

### Project 🚧
For this case study, we suggest that you put yourselves in our shoes, and run an analysis we made back in 2017 🔮 🪄

When using Getaround, drivers book cars for a specific time period, from an hour to a few days long. They are supposed to bring back the car on time, but it happens from time to time that drivers are late for the checkout.

Late returns at checkout can generate high friction for the next driver if the car was supposed to be rented again on the same day : Customer service often reports users unsatisfied because they had to wait for the car to come back from the previous rental or users that even had to cancel their rental because the car wasn’t returned on time.

### Goals 🎯
In order to mitigate those issues we’ve decided to implement a minimum delay between two rentals. A car won’t be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental.

It solves the late checkout issue but also potentially hurts Getaround/owners revenues: we need to find the right trade off.

Our Product Manager still needs to decide:
- threshold: how long should the minimum delay be?
- scope: should we enable the feature for all cars?, only Connect cars?

In order to help them make the right decision, they are asking you for some data insights. Here are the first analyses they could think of, to kickstart the discussion. Don’t hesitate to perform additional analysis that you find relevant.
- Which share of our owner’s revenue would potentially be affected by the feature?
- How many rentals would be affected by the feature depending on the threshold and scope we choose?
- How often are drivers late for the next check-in? How does it impact the next driver?
- How many problematic cases will it solve depending on the chosen threshold and scope?

### Web dashboard
First build a dashboard that will help the product Management team with the above questions. You can use streamlit or any other technology that you see fit.

### Machine Learning - /predict endpoint
In addition to the above question, the Data Science team is working on pricing optimization. They have gathered some data to suggest optimum prices for car owners using Machine Learning.

### Online production

You have to host your API online. We recommend you to use Hugging Face as it is free of charge. But you are free to choose any other hosting provider.

## Block 6 - Final Project - Offensive Speech Detection

**Project Link:** [Final Project - Offensive Speech Recognition](https://github.com/llepogam/JEDHA/tree/main/Block%206%20-%20Final%20Project%20-%20Offensive%20Speech%20Detection)

### Context

Major tech platforms have been reducing their focus on content moderation in recent years, leading to a documented increase in hate speech and offensive content online. As highlighted by news reports and research, these policy shifts have created a growing need for accessible tools that can help identify potentially harmful content. This project addresses that gap by providing an open-source solution for offensive speech detection.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a complete machine learning pipeline for offensive speech detection - from data extraction to user-facing applications. The pipeline includes:

Data acquisition and preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
Model deployment via MLflow
API development for prediction services
User-friendly web application

This end-to-end implementation demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, with particular focus on deploying a fully functional system that can be used in real-world scenarios.
