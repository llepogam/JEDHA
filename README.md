<!-- PROJECT 1 -->
## Block 1 - Project Kayak

**Project Link:** []()

### Description

Project ðŸš§

The marketing team needs help on a new project. After doing some user research, the team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

In addition, user research shows that people tend to be defiant about the information they are reading if they don't know the brand which produced the content.

Therefore, Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:

- Weather.
- Hotels in the area.

The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

Goals ðŸŽ¯

As the project has just started, your team doesn't have any data that can be used to create this application. Therefore, your job will be to:

- Scrape data from destinations.
- Get weather data from each destination.
- Get hotels' info about each destination.
- Store all the information above in a data lake.
- Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse.

## Block 2 - Project Tinder

**Project Link:** []()

Project ðŸš§

The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

Goals ðŸŽ¯
Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:

You may use descriptive statistics
You may use visualisations

## Block 2 - Project Steam

**Project Link:** []()

Project ðŸš§
You're working for Ubisoft, a French video game publisher. They'd like to release a new revolutionary videogame! They asked you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.

Goals ðŸŽ¯
The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

To carry out this project, you will have to adopt different levels of analysis. Your boss gave you a list of examples of questions that would be interesting:

Analysis at the "macro" level
- Which publisher has released the most games on Steam?
- What are the best rated games?
- Are there years with more releases? Were there more or fewer game releases during the Covid, for example?
- How are the prizes distributed? Are there many games with a discount?
- What are the most represented languages?
- Are there many games prohibited for children under 16/18?

Genres analysis
- What are the most represented genres?
- Are there any genres that have a better positive/negative review ratio?
- Do some publishers have favorite genres?
- What are the most lucrative genres?

Platform analysis
- Are most games available on Windows/Mac/Linux instead?
- Do certain genres tend to be preferentially available on certain platforms?
- You're free to follow these guidelines, or to choose a different angle of analysis, as long as your analysis reveals relevant and useful information. ðŸ¤“

## Block 3 - Project Walmart

**Project Link:** []()

Company's Description ðŸ“‡
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

Project ðŸš§
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be divided into three steps:

Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

<!-- PROJECT 5 -->
## Block 3 - Conversion Rate

**Project Link:** []()

Project ðŸš§
The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

Goals ðŸŽ¯
The project can be cut into four steps :

Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file data_train.csv
Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file data_test.csv. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA ðŸ¤“). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?
